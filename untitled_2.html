      <h1>Paths Yet Untraveled: Things That I Could Be</h1>

      <p>
        Sometimes I wonder what would’ve happened if I took writing seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in high school, I used to jot down random thoughts in notebooks, on
        the back of receipts, even on my phone at 2 AM when I couldn’t sleep.
        Short dialogues, unfinished poems, scenes that played out in my head
        like clips from a movie. A few teachers told me I had potential. One
        even said, “You could be a writer.” I didn’t think much of it at the
        time, but that comment stayed with me longer than I expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was something about writing that felt... right. Natural. Like it
        let me slow down and actually process the world. But as I got older,
        life started demanding more practical things. I leaned into tech. It
        felt safer, more structured—coding, design, web development. Skills that
        paid bills. Skills people actually hired for.
      </p>
      <p>
        And honestly, I don’t regret it. I’ve learned a lot, worked with some
        great people, and I like building things that actually function. Still,
        every now and then, I catch myself staring at a blank Google Doc or
        scribbling in the margins of a notebook again. There’s this voice in the
        back of my mind that says,<mark>
          “You could’ve written that story. You could’ve finished that novel
          idea you had back in 2020.</mark
        >”
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep a folder on my laptop named “Someday.” It’s filled with
        unfinished drafts, random titles, half-baked characters. I open it once
        in a while just to remind myself that the writer in me is still
        there—quiet, maybe, but not gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t choose writing. Not fully, anyway. But part of me still hopes
        that one day, even if it’s just for me, I’ll write the kind of story I
        always wanted to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe I’m not a writer by profession. But I’m still someone with
        something to say.
      </p>

      <p>And maybe that’s enough for now.</p>
