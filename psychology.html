      <p>I’ve been thinking about it more lately —</p>
      <p>Maybe I don’t belong here.</p>
      <p>
        Not in a dramatic, throwing-my-laptop-out-the-window way. Just… quietly.
        Like I’m walking through a room full of people who all seem to know what
        they're doing, while I’m still trying to remember why I walked in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some days I open up my laptop, stare at the code editor, and feel like
        I'm faking everything. Tutorials pile up. New tools pop up every week.
        There’s always someone younger, faster, smarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I can’t help but wonder —
        <b>what if I had taken that Psychology course when I had the chance?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember back then, I was torn. I liked how the mind worked, how
        people behave, how emotions shaped decisions. But tech felt like the
        <i>right move</i>. The one with better opportunities, better pay, more
        future. Everyone said so.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I went for it. I learned Front end Development. I told myself, “You
        got this.” And for a while, I did. I made a few things. Some looked
        decent. I was proud.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now? The industry feels… heavy. Like I’m running to catch a train
        that keeps getting faster. Like I blinked and suddenly I’m behind again.
      </p>

      <p>And here’s the thing:</p>
      <p>
        It’s not that I hate tech. I actually still like building stuff. But I
        also wonder what my life would look like now if I had leaned into
        understanding people instead of pixels. If I had followed that small
        voice instead of the loud advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess what I’m really saying is: <br />
        I feel lost. <br />
        And I don’t know if I’m just burned out, or if I’m truly in the wrong
        place.
      </p>

      <p>
        But maybe that’s okay. Maybe it’s part of figuring things out. Maybe a
        lot of people feel this way but never say it out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here I am — not quitting, not giving up, just pausing. <br />
        Sitting with the question: <br />
        “Do I really want to be here?” <br />
        And waiting to hear whatever honest answer comes next.
      </p>
