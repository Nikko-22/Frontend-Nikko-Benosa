        When I graduated, I thought things would fall into place right away.
        That all the late nights, requirements, and pressure would finally pay
        off. That there’d be a job waiting. A path cleared. A “welcome to your
        dream career” moment.
      </p>

      <p>But it didn’t happen like that.</p>

      <p>
        I watched some of my batchmates land jobs at big companies just weeks
        after we got our diplomas. I saw Instagram posts of “First day at work!”
        and LinkedIn updates that sounded like success stories already written.
        <br />
        And I started to wonder —<i> Did I miss something?</i> <br /><i></i>
          Was I already falling behind?</i
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        But slowly — quietly — I realized something that brought me peace:
        <b> We don’t all arrive at the same time</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some people find their dream job early, and that’s beautiful. But for
        others, it takes a little longer. Sometimes you need to explore, fail,
        start over, get lost, or take a detour you didn’t expect — not because
        you’re doing it wrong, but because
        <b>your journey isn’t supposed to look like anyone else’s</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used to think success was a straight line. Now I know it’s more like a
        messy map — some scribbles, some backtracks, a few blank pages. And
        that’s okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe this phase — this space between where I am and where I want to be
        — is still part of the story. <br />
        Maybe I’m not late. <br />
        Maybe I’m just becoming.
      </p>
