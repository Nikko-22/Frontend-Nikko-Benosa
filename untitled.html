      <h1>The Last Day of College: Farewell to a Chapter</h1>
      <small>Looking Back, Moving Forward &nbsp;&nbsp;-- 2 min read --</small>
      <p>
        The sun felt warmer that day, or maybe it was just the mix of emotions
        brewing in my chest. I walked through the campus slowly, letting my eyes
        scan every detail - the cracks on the pavement I used to rush over, the
        trees that provided shade for lunch breaks, and the benches that held
        countless conversations, laughter, and the occasional nap.
      </p>

      <p>It was the last day of college.</p>

      <p>
        Our final class ended with a few half-hearted claps and scattered hugs.
        There were no more exams to cram for, no more group chats exploding with
        panic. Just the silence of realizatio... we were done.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few friends and I sat outside our favorite spot near the library, the
        same place we'd shared stories, dreams, and sometimes tears. We talked
        about the future, but the conversations always circled back to the
        pastâ€”funny memories from freshman year, unforgettable professors, failed
        presentations, and spontaneous adventures.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was something so surreal about knowing that this place, which once
        felt endless, was now just a memory in the making.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I hugged my friends goodbye, I realized we weren't just parting
        ways... we were growing into different versions of ourselves. College
        had shaped us, but it was time to take that growth out into the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I took one last walk through the empty hallway, looked back, and smiled.
        That chapter was over, but the story was far from finished.
      </p>
